The test cases cover different modules, including the login page, bank account management, bank deposit, money withdrawal, transfer between accounts, and the sign-up page. Each test case provides detailed instructions on preconditions, steps to execute, and the expected outcome. Please ensure that you use the specified test data while performing the tests. After executing each test case, compare the actual results with the expected results and update the status field accordingly (pass or fail).
